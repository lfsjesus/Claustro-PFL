## Game Description

### Board

Claustro uses a 5x5 board/grid. Typically, the board is diagonally oriented between the **two players**. The two corners closest to each player are each other players' goal. 

The other two corners of the board are neutral zones, where no pieces can be placed.

### Pieces

Each player has 4 pieces. Initially, each pair of pieces is placed next to each other starting in each square orthogonally adjacent to the player starting corner.

To disinguish between the two players, each player has a different color, for example, green and blue.

### Gameplay

Players take turns moving one of their pieces. In each turn, a player can move one of its pieces in the following ways:

- **Move**: Move a piece one square orthoganally towards the goal (considering it is not occupied).

- **Capture**: Captures are made by jumping one square (where there is an opponent's piece) diagonally. The captured piece is **not removed** from the board, but placed in any of the other free squares in the board, by the player who captured it, before the next turn.

This procedure shall be repeated until one of the following conditions is met:
- A player successfully moves one of his pieces on his goal (opponent starting corner). In this case, he **wins the game.**

- A player cannot move nor capture opponent pieces with any of his pieces. In this case, he **wins the game.**

- Both players repeat the same move 3 times each. In this case, the last player to move **wins the game.**
